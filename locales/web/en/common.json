    "subtitle1": "Background",
    "paragraph1": "In 2020, the Expertise and Professional Services Group (KKLP) for Translation was formed by the Head of the Language Development and Guidance Agency (Badan Bahasa). In 2021, KKLP Translation was mandated by the Minister of Education and Culture to translate 1,250 high-quality children's storybooks that could build the character of Indonesian children. At that time, the pandemic was sweeping across the globe and we were faced with new ways of communicating. Our first meeting began with a Zoom meeting with a small team from The Asia Foundation, who offered to collaborate in translating and publishing children's storybooks that highlight regional cultures and languages in Indonesia on their Let's Read website. The journey did not stop there; we also looked for other sources to fulfill the Minister's request. We ended up searching for a digital library browser that provides books with a CC by 4.0 license. That's when we found the digital library created by Pratham Books, Storyweaver. Thanks to the excellent collaboration between the Language Agency, The Asia Foundation-Let's Read, and Pratham Books-Storyweaver, KKLP Translation was able to meet and even exceed its 2021 translation target of translating 1,375 children's storybooks and publishing them online. Until 2024, the collaboration will continue with the same targets as in 2021. We hope that with more reading materials for children in Indonesia, there will be an increase in interest in reading and in preserving language and culture throughout Indonesia.",

    "partner1Desc": "Let's Read!, initiated by the literacy program Books for Asia, has had 18 representative offices in Asia since 1954, one of which is in Indonesia. The literacy program received the US Library of Congress Literacy Awards in December 2017 for its innovation in promoting literacy. Let's Read! has become a digital library for children's storybooks, presented by the literacy community and The Asia Foundation, which strives to provide children in Asia with access to knowledge about their local languages and cultures. The books on Let's Read! are freely licensed and can be used and translated into various languages in Asia.",
    "partner2": "2. Storyweaver",
    "partner2Desc": "Storyweaver was created by Pratham Books in 2015. Storyweaver is a platform for creating and distributing books for children who are disadvantaged in terms of access to reading materials in their native language. Storyweaver has become a digital repository of multilingual children's storybooks with open licenses sourced from global publishers and Pratham Books itself. Open licenses allow these children's storybooks to be read offline, downloaded, printed, and even reused so that every child in the world can access them. Translation tools help children read books from around the world in their native languages. The books available on Storyweaver are mostly STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) based, supporting the Merdeka Belajar (Freedom to Learn) program launched by the Minister of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology."
