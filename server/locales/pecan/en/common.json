    "subtitle1": "Background",
    "paragraph1": "In 2020, the Expertise and Professional Services Group (KKLP) for Translation, now renamed the Translation Working Team, was formed by the Head of the Language Development and Guidance Agency (Badan Bahasa). The Translation ESPG was mandated by the Minister of Education and Culture for the period 2021-2025 to translate 5,000 high-quality children's storybooks that can build the character of Indonesian children. At that time, the pandemic was sweeping across the world and we were faced with new ways of communicating. Our first meeting began with a Zoom meeting with a small team from The Asia Foundation, who offered to collaborate in translating and publishing children's storybooks that highlight regional cultures and languages in Indonesia on their website: Let's Read. The journey did not stop there. We also looked for other sources to meet the Minister's request. We searched for a browser for digital libraries that provide books with a CC by 4.0 license. That was when we found digital libraries created by various institutions. Thanks to the excellent collaboration between the Language Agency, The Asia Foundation-Let's Read, Pratham Books-Storyweaver, and the Global Digital Library, KKLP Translation was able to meet and even exceed its 2021 translation target of translating 1,375 children's storybooks and publishing them online. Until 2025, the collaboration will continue with the same targets as in 2021. We hope that the increasing number of children's reading materials in Indonesia will also increase interest in reading and interest in preserving language and culture in all regions of Indonesia.",
